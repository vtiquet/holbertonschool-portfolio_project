* Hold an initial meeting to introduce team members and their backgrounds, strengths, and interests.

* Establish team norms for communication, collaboration, and decision-making (e.g., using tools like Slack, Discord, or Microsoft Teams).

### 1. Brainstorming and Idea evaluation <a name='subparagraph1'></a>

Conduct individual and group research on potential project ideas. Look for inspiration from real-world problems, industry trends, or innovative solutions.

Organize a brainstorming session using techniques like:

* Mind Mapping: Visualize related ideas and their connections.


  * SCAMPER Framework: Explore ways to innovate existing ideas (Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Put to another use, Eliminate, Reverse).
  * “How Might We” Questions: Frame opportunities with open-ended problem-solving prompts.



* Define evaluation criteria (e.g., feasibility, potential impact, technical alignment, scalability).
* List project ideas with a short description of each idea
* Rank ideas based on feasibility, challenges, risks and impact.

### 2. Decision and Refinement <a name='subparagraph2'></a>

* Select the final MVP idea based on team discussions and evaluation results.
* For pre-assigned MVPs, brainstorm enhancements or specific challenges to focus on.
* Refine and detail the selected idea by defining:


  * The problem it solves.
  * The solution (main feature or goal) it provides to the final user.
  * Its target audience / users.
  * What kind of application is it ? (mobile, web, desktop etc…) and more details if applicable.
  * Why did you choose this idea over the others ? (give logical reasons based on what you’ve worked on when brainstorming).
  * Mention at least 2 to 3 Key features and objectives that the MVP will achieve. (<a href="/rltoken/O5_BG-w4h4BtdTrG5IsZHg" target="_blank" title="How to write SMART goals">How to write SMART goals</a>)
  * Describe what the project will deliver (in-scope) and what it will not (out-of-scope)


    * Example:


      * <strong>In-Scope</strong>: A mobile app with basic expense tracking and data visualization.
      * <strong>Out-of-Scope</strong>: Advanced financial planning features (e.g., investment tracking).

    * Mention identified risks and Challenges and how to mitigate them


      * Example:
      * Risk: Team members lack experience with required tools.
      * Mitigation: Schedule tutorials and assign learning time in the early stages.
